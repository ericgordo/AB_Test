# AB_Test


This project was a mock AB test writeup completed to recommend actions after a test was completed for Udacity. 
The write-up, statistical tests, and calculations were all conducted just as a real AB test would be done, 
however the data itself is fake, and not actually collected data from the Udacity company.

The write up shows my analysis, thoughts, and reasoning through the entire project, while the excel sheets show
the data, and the calculations done for this report.
